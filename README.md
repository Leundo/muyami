# Muyami

Muyami is a markdown editor which was built based on [Muya](https://github.com/marktext/muya), which was originally used in the open-source software, [Marktext](https://github.com/marktext/marktext). Muya was the starting point for building Muyami after it was separated from Marktext. While Muya has its own independent repository, the old version of Muya in that repository is no longer actively maintained.

The name "Muyami" is derived from the "Muya" and Japanese word "Muyami", which means "unreasonable" or "unjustifiable".
